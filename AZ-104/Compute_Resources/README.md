# Azure Region, Single availability and availability zones.

![alt text](Regions.png)

## Azure Regions
- Regions are located across many different geographies. 
- Each geography represents a data residency boundary, for example the United States, or Europe, and may contain one or more regions. 
- Each region is a set of physical facilities that include datacenters and networking infrastructure.

## Availabilty Zones
-  Availability zones are independent sets of datacenters that contain isolated power, cooling, and network connections. 
- Availability zones are physically located close enough together to provide a low-latency network, but far enough apart to provide fault isolation from such things as storms and isolated power outages. 

## Azure VM Size for diff purposes.

# Azure Managed Disk for VM.
- These are block-level storage volumes that are managed by azure.
- These disks are highly available and durable.
- you can create and attach this disk to a VM during provision and after provision of VM.

## Disk Roles:

  **1. OS Disk**

- Every VM is comes with OS Disk while creating VM.
- This will have installed OS on it.
- Store OS-level logs and configurations.
- Stores the OS and system files.

  **2. Data Disk**

- Store user/application data.
- useful for stores large size data for Databases, app data, custom services.
- Use Premium SSD/Ultra disk for performance (e.g., SQL)

  **3. Temporary Disk**

- Bydefault the VM will get the temporary disk. It is based on VM Sizes.
- Any data is stored into this Tmp Disk will be lost during stop, restart , disaster/maintenance event and Reployed the VM.

    ## ðŸ‘‰ In short:

    | Disk Roles | Use Cases |
    | --------- | --------------------------------- |
    | OS Disk | for running the VM (system + boot) |
    | Data Disk | for your workloads and persistent app/user data.|

# Azure Disk Types:

![alt text](DiskTypes.png)

- You can add data disk druing and after provision of VM.

    ## ðŸ‘‰ Best Recommendation for attach disk:

  **1. First stope the vm which has attached the data disk.**

  **2. Detach the data disk from that VM.**

```bash
az vm disk detach --resource-group MyRG --vm-name MyVM --name myDataDisk
```

  3. **Attach this data disk to Targeted VM.**

```bash
az vm disk attach --resource-group MyRG --vm-name TargetVM --name myDataDisk
```

# Azure Disk - Server-side Encryptions

- The data is stored in the azure disk.
- when you want to read the data the data will be decrypted and when you want to store or make data to disk, the encryption will done by using encryption keys and algorithm.
- so when a malicious users want to get the data, they would need the key and alogrithm to decrypt the data.

- you can use either **Platform managed keys** or **Custom managed keys** that will be managed by the user itself.

- you have to use Azure key vault to store the encryption keys as customer-managed keys.


## Disk Encryption Sets
**why we required use of data encryption sets ?**

- Data Encryption sets is required when you want to Centrally manage Encryption for Disk using Customer-Managed keys with **Full control, flexibility * Policy enforcement across multiple resources**.

- You have to define your key vault and encryption key into Disk Encryption Sets

**Scope:**

- VM OS/Data disks doesn't supports direct customer-managed keys links.
- you must use a data encryption set to associate a CMK with a Disk.
- Once defined key source as key vault, you can reuse it across multiple disks or VM.

**Without Customer Managed Key**
---

- Encrypts your VM Disks by Server Side.
- But key is stored & Controlled by azure.
- You can't see, rotate  or revoke key.
- You can't stop access if you suspect data risk.

**With CMK + Data Encryption Sets**
---

- You can hold/keep the key in key vault.
- Full Visible of key.
- Can rotate the key.
- Can disable / delete the key to instantly block the acces to disk.

# Way for Pre-Deployment in VM during Provision of VM ?

There are 2 ways
  1. Cloud init

```yml
#cloud-config
package_update: true
packages:
  - nginx
```

  2. Custome script extensions.

- you have to use SA where your nginx.sh file is stored in container/blob.

# What is VM Image ?

- Taking the snapshot of VM is called VM Image.
- There are 2 types of image

  1. Specialized Image
  2. Generalized VM Image

## How to create Image ?

- Chooswe VM , click on Create Image.

![alt text](vmimage.png)

- You can select Specialized or Generalized Image.
- Give the Versin number for Image.

- After created this image , you can deploy a new VM with Same Configuration and data. You will not requires the reinstall the weapp etc.
- Choose img during provisions.

![alt text](Spdeploy.png)

- Go to Shared image. here you will found your created image.
- This image will stored in azure compute gallery.

# Way for Post-deployment in VM during Provision of VM ?

There is 2 way for Post-deployment

1. Custom-Script-Extension 

- You can deploy your applications or required pkg usig custom script extensions.
- SA required to store the script file

2. Run Commands

- RDP/SSH is not required to run script.
- SA is not required.
- Working as same as custom script extensions.

Proximity Placement Group
---

- To get VMs as close as possible, achieving the lowest possible latency, you should deploy them within a proximity placement group.

- A proximity placement group is a logical grouping used to make sure that Azure compute resources are physically located close to each other. 
- Proximity placement groups are useful for workloads where low latency is a requirement.

- Low latency between stand-alone VMs.
- Low Latency between VMs in a single availability set or a virtual machine scale set.
- Low latency between stand-alone VMs, VMs in multiple Availability Sets, or multiple scale sets.

![alt text](proximity.png)

- For the lowest latency, **use proximity placement groups together with accelerated networking**. 

Azure Web App
---

- Azure Web App is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) offering in Azure App Service.
- It allows you to host web applications, REST APIs, or mobile app backends without managing servers.

- You cab deploy your code for Node.js, .NET, Java, Python, PHP, etc.
- Scaling (manual or auto)
- you can deploy code from github url, uploading zip files.
- You dont have to manage infra , only have to just push the application code.
- you can test your code with test env. after testing you can publish your app to prod code via **Deployment Slot**. 

**Deployment Slot**
- You can SWAP to your previous version of app while your prod app is downs.
- Bydefault your app is deployed into prod web slots.
- While you required to test of your new versions of web app, you can't publish/testing on your prod.
- you will first test on **Staging Slot**, then publish it.
- after publish your new version, it still to pointing the older/prod web slots older version of web app.
- To publish new version of web app , you have to perform the **SWAP**.

**SWAP**
- your new version of web app will go to the prod slot form staging slot
- your older web app will go t staging slot from prod slot.
- If your new version of web app failed in prod and want to roll back to older version, you can swap back.

**To create Deployment slot, your web app service plan mst have to upgrade to Std/premium plans.**

Redeploy and Reappy to VM
---

**Redploy** 
- While you can't connect to VM. 
- VM will migrate to diff host.
- VM will unavailable.
- Any data in temp. drive will be lost.

**Reapply**
- Rerun the VM Provisioning to solve the VM Failed state from azure side.

Availability set
---
- Logical grouping of VM help to high availability by reduce the chances of going down the VM.
- Just create Availability set & deploy VM.
- Once VM is deploy, you can't set to availability sets.
- you can only set the VM at time of create VM or Availability set is already created.

  Availability set includes
  ---
  **1. Fault Domains**
  - Represents a physical racks in the datacenters.
  - VM in diff FD.
  - Default FD is 2 & Max FD is 3.
  - Protects VM agains hardware failures, Power/Ntwork outage.

  **2. Update Domains**
  - While performs maintanence, only one UD will rebooted at a time, then the next UD will rebooted.
  - This will maintain the High availability of applications during Pre-Planned maintenance or upgradations.
  - VM in diff UD will not be rebooted together.
  - Ex. if 1 UD has 4 and another 2 UD has vm. so only 4 VM will be rebooted.
  - Defult UD is 5 and Max UD is 20

- Each availability set can have up to 3 fault domains and 20 update domains.

    ![alt text](FDUD.png)

Ex. You have 14 VM. FD is 3 and UD is 5. How the All VM will be spreads across FD and UD ?
What will be the Min and Max VM for FD and UD ?

**Fault Domains**
- 14 divided by 3 equals 4 with a remainder of 2. 

- This means two FDs will each contain 5 VMs (4 + 1), and one FD will contain 4 VMs.

- The distribution will be 5, 5, and 4 VMs per FD.

During Maintennance Min FD VM will affected will 4 and Max VM for FD will 5

**Update Domains**
- 14 divided by 5 equals 2 with a remainder of 4.

- This means four UDs will each contain 3 VMs (2 + 1), and one UD will contain 2 VMs.

- The distribution will be 3, 3, 3, 3, and 2 VMs per UD.

Min UD VM will be affected is 2 and Max VM for UD is 3.

Azure Container Registry
---
- We can store our docker image into ACR instead of docker hub.
- This are the private registry that can be used for storing your docker-based images.

Azure Container Instance
---

- It is a docker container on azure and managed by azure.
- you can push your docker image to your ACR.
- Azure container will be pull img from ACR and publish your applications on particular port.

- To push your img to ACR , follow the below steps.

```bash
sudo docker login < login_server_name > -u < username > -p < password >
```

- To give tag to your image as your ACR name
```bash
sudo docker tag < img_name > < ACR_login_server_name/img_name >
```

- To push img to your ACR
```bash
sudo docker push < ACR_login_server_name/img_name >
```

- Deploy your app to azure container
```bash
az container create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name mycontainer --image ACR_login_server_name/img_name --dns-name-label aci-demo --ports 80 --os-type linux --memory 1.5 --cpu 1
```
