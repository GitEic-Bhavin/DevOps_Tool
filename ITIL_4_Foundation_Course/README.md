**Focus on value** - It means Everything we do as part of services. Every tasks an org does , should create value for stackholders especially it should fouces on user experience and give better consumer experience so that thete can be continuity continually the value will realized by the consumers.

üëâ Always do things that bring value to customers or the business.

**Start where you are** - Ensure that org assess and analyze the current scenario to identify and improve thing on a continual basis.

üëâ If your company already has a helpdesk system, improve it instead of buying a new one immediately.

**Progress iteratively with feedback**
üëâ Take small steps, test, get feedback, then move forward.
Ex. Instead of building a whole new website in 6 months, release a small part, get user feedback, then improve further.

**Collaborate and promote visibility**
üëâ Work together, share knowledge, and avoid working in silos.
Ex. Developers, testers, and support teams should communicate openly so issues are solved faster.

**Think and work holistically**
üëâ Look at the big picture, not just one part.
Ex. If email is down, don‚Äôt just check the server; think about networks, security, and user devices too.

**Keep it simple and practical**
üëâ Don‚Äôt make things more complicated than needed.

**Optimize and automate**
üëâ First make processes efficient, then automate them.
Ex. If password reset takes too much time, first simplify the process, then set up a self-service reset system.

**Governance**
It is reponsivle for Evaulating, Directing & Monitoring the ITSM, by adopting the Guiding principles defined in ITIL 4 Framework.

There are three main activity in Governance

1. Evaluate, 2. Direct, 3. Monitor

  **1. Evaluate** - This performes a regular review of the services based on the stackholder's requirements.

  üëâ Check the situation, options, and risks before making decisions.
  Ex. Management reviews if a new cloud service is secure, cost-effective, and useful before approving it.
  
  **2. Direct** - whatever is provided based on the evaluations done for the ITSM org. Accordingly the required directions can be accomplished.

  üëâ Give instructions, set goals, and make policies for teams to follow.
  Ex. Management decides ‚ÄúWe must move 50% of apps to the cloud in 1 year‚Äù and tells IT teams what to do.

  **3. Monitor** - 
  - It monitors the performance of the org and checks whether its practices, products and services are inline withthe direction given by the governing body.

  üëâ Watch results, check performance, and see if goals are being achieved.
  Ex. Management checks reports every month to see if apps are really moving to the cloud as planned.
